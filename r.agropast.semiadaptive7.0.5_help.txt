GRASS GIS manual: r.agropast.semiadaptive7.0.5

DESCRIPTION

r.agropast.semiadaptive7.0.5  - Simulates agricultural and pastoral landuse and tracks yields and environmental impacts. Basic farming and grazing strategies and yield goals are predetermined by the researcher, and do not change (adapt) during the simulation, but it is possible for population to change based on returns. This version implments a land tenuring alogrithm. Requires r.landscape.evol. Note that some stats files will be written to current mapset, and will be appended to if you run the simulation again with the same prefix.

FLAGS:

-p
-p Allow the population to vary over time, according to subsistence returns

-f
-f Do not graze in unused portions of the agricultural catchment (i.e., do not graze on "fallowed" fields, and thus no "manuring" of those fields will occur)

-g
-g Do not allow "stubble grazing" on harvested fields (and thus no "manuring" of fields)

-c
-c Keep C-factor (and rainfall excess) maps for each year

-1
-1 Calculate streams as 1D difference instead of 2D divergence

-k
-k Keep ALL temporary maps (overides flags -drst). This will make A LOT of maps!

-d
-d Don't output yearly soil depth maps

-r
-r Don't output yearly maps of the erosion/deposition rates ("ED_rate" map, in vertical meters)

-s
-s Keep all slope maps

-t
-t Keep yearly maps of the Transport Capacity at each cell ("Qs" maps)

-e
-e Keep yearly maps of the Excess Transport Capacity (divergence) at each cell ("DeltaQs" maps)

animals=float
Number of herd animals that would be needed per person per year if pastoral products were the ONLY food item
Default: 60

fodderreq=float
Amount of fodder required per herd animal per year (Kg)
Default: 680

a_p_ratio=float
Actual ratio of agricultural to pastoral foods in the diet (0-1, where 0 = 100% agricultural and 1 = 100% pastoral)
Options: 0.0-1.0
Default: 0.20

costsurf=string
Map of movement costs from the center of the agricultural/grazing catchments (from r.walk or r.cost).

agcatch=string
Map of the largest possible agricultural catchment map (From r.catchment or r.buffer, where catchment is a single integer value, and all else is NULL)

agmix=float
The wheat/barley ratio (e.g., 0.0 for all wheat, 1.0 for all barley, 0.5 for an equal mix)
Options: 0.0-1.0
Default: 0.25

nsfieldsize=float
North-South dimension of fields in map units (Large field sizes may lead to some overshoot of catchment boundaries)
Default: 20

ewfieldsize=float
East-West dimension of fields in map units (Large field sizes may lead to some overshoot of catchment boundaries)
Default: 50

fieldlabor=float
Number of person-days required to till, sow, weed, and harvest one farm field in a year.

farmval=float
The landcover value for farmed fields (Should correspond to an appropriate value from your landcover rules file.)
Default: 5

farmimpact=float[,float,...]
The mean and standard deviation of the amount to which farming a patch decreases its fertility (in percentage points of maximum fertility, entered as: "mean,std_dev"). Fertility impact values of indvidual farm plots will be randomly chosen from a gaussian distribution that has this mean and std_dev.
Default: 3,2

maxwheat=float
Maximum amount of wheat that can be grown (kg/ha)
Default: 1750

maxbarley=float
Maximum amount of barley that can be grown (kg/ha)
Default: 1250

tenuretype=string
Choose the land tenuring strategy: "None" (Fields are chosen at random each year), "Satisficing" (First year's fields are chosen at random. Fields are tenured, but some may be randomly dropped or added to meet the minimum need), "Maximizing" (Same as "satisficing", but tenured fields are only dropped if production falls below the threshold defined by "tenuredrop," not according to minimum need.)
Options: None, Maximize, Satisfice
Default: Maximize

tenuredrop=float
Threshold for dropping land out of tenure (with tenuretype as "Maximize"). If the value is 0, fields that yield less than the mean of all fields are dropped. If the value is greater than 0, then fields that are lower than that percentage of the maximum yield of all fields will be dropped.
Options: 0.0-1.0
Default: 0.1

grazecatch=string
Map of the largest possible grazing catchment (From r.catchment or r.buffer, where catchment is a single integer value, and all else is NULL).

mingraze=float
Minimum amount of vegetation on a cell for it to be considered grazeable (in value of succession stages, matching landcover rules file)
Default: 2

grazespatial=float
Spatial dependency of the grazing pattern in map units. This value determines how "clumped" grazing patches will be. A value close to 0 will produce a perfectly randomized grazing pattern with patch size=resolution, and larger values will produce increasingly clumped grazing patterns, with the size of the patches corresponding to the value of grazespatial (in map units).
Default: 50

grazepatchy=float
Coefficient that determines the patchiness of the grazing catchemnt. Value must be non-zero, and usually will be &lt;= 1.0. Values close to 0 will create a patchy grazing pattern, values close to 1 will create a "smooth" grazing pattern. Actual grazing patches will be sized to the resolution of the input landcover map.
Default: 1.0

maxgrazeimpact=integer
Maximum impact of grazing in units of "landcover.succession". Grazing impact values of individual patches will be chosen from a gaussian distribution between 1 and this maximum value (i.e., most values will be between 1 and this max). Value must be &gt;= 1.
Default: 3

manurerate=float
Base rate that animal dung contributes to fertility increase on a grazed patch in units of percentage of maximum fertility regained per increment of grazing impact. Actual fertility regain values are thus calculated as "manure_rate x grazing_impact", so be aware that this variable interacts with the grazing impact settings you have chosen.

Default: 0.03

fodder_rules=string

Default: /home/iullah/Dropbox/Scripts_Working_Dir/rules/fodder_rules.txt

fertilrate=float[,float,...]
Comma separated list of the mean and standard deviation of the natural fertility recovery rate (percentage by which soil fertility increases per year if not farmed, entered as: "mean,stdev".)
